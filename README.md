## Introductory
A brief summary of your findings and background data (similar to an abstract) that should be approximately 150-250 words

## Outline of Research
An outline of your industry question → data question → data answer → industry answer process and findings that may be formatted in any way that best displays your data analysis process. This section should be between 700-1000 words, but doesn’t need to be in paragraph form (e.g. you can use bullet points) to elaborate on your question, data results, and future recommendations/findings. One of these sections should include at least one data visualization.

   Business/industry/civic/research question
o   Make sure your audience understands why you wanted to answer this question and why it’s important to you (and to them!)
o   Talk through stories, anecdotes, statistics, news stories, etc. to show the relevance of this problem and what could happen when we find out the answer (now and into the future)
·      Data question
o   What kind of data was important to use to answer this question, how did you find it, and why did you use this information? Was there some data that you wish you had? If so, how would you change your approach?
o   What metrics did you think were important to understanding a quantitative answer to your original question and why? Did you “translate” any of your data into numbers?
o   Did you base your data analysis on another type of analysis or desired outcome?
·      Data solution
o   What were the results of your data analysis and how did this contribute to your final solution?
o   What type of visualizations can best demonstrate what you found and what you think is important to emphasize to your audience?
·      Business/industry/civic/research solution
o   What’s the answer? Were you able to come to any type of conclusive answer—why or why not?
o   How would you build on your analysis if given more time?
o   What do these answers mean for us in the real world?
o   What do these answers mean for the audience in this industry?
